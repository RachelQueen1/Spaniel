# Diversity and Inclusion Statement

Newcastle University is an organisation committed to creating a positive, supportive culture where individual differences, and the diversity this brings are valued. The university is proud to be a member of the Athena SWAN Charter recognising employment practices which promote gender equality. The Spaniel project will be true to these same core values, and we will create an inclusive culture where diversity is an asset to the development of the project.

# Code of Conduct

We will promote a supportive, harassment-free working environment for everyone, regardless of: gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We will not tolerate harassment, intimidation, or bullying in the work place, social media or via any other platform.
 2.	Where appropriate staff will be given access to university Occupational Health & Safety Service (OHSS) to ensure that any physical or mental health or specific safety needs are not a barrier to their work.

 4.	Researchers will be made aware of the Newcastle University Dignity and Respect policy[^1] and be expected to adhere to these guidelines at all times.
 5.	All members of staff will be encouraged to report cases of misconduct via either an anonymous or personal reporting system. Any reports of misconduct will be fully investigated and the appropriate action taken to ensure that they do not reoccur.
