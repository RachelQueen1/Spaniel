To create the expression matrix, from the sequencing data, the paired FASTQ 
files were demultiplexed with a publically available perl script 50 
(https://github.com/tallulandrews/scRNASeqPipeline/blob/master/0_custom_undo_demultiplexing.
51 pl) using the spatial barcodes encoded in read 1. 
Read 2 from successfully demultiplexed pairs were
trimmed for quality using Trimmomatic version 0.36 6 52. 
A reference was created using Ensembl
53 mouse reference genome Release M20 (GRCm38.p6). 
The trimmed reads were aligned to this reference using STAR version 2.5.3a 7 
in single read alignment mode. The number of reads were quantified using HTSEQ 
version 0.6.1 8 and a count matrix was created. The H & E images were
56 cropped to region around the edges of the spots and resized to 1000 x 1071 
pixels with a resolution of 72dpi using a photo editor.
